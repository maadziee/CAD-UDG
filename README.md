# Introduction
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for 2 challenging tasks: binary classification of benign and malignant skin lesions and three classes classification of Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The model is trained using the extracted features from the images.

# Dataset
The dataset includes dermoscopic images in JPEG format with a distribution that reflects real-world settings, where benign cases outnumber malignant ones but with an overrepresentation of malignancies. The images come from:
- HAM10000 Dataset (ViDIR Group, Medical University of Vienna)
- BCN_20000 Dataset (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona)
- MSK Dataset (ISBI 2017)

The dataset consists of more than 15,000 images for binary classification and around 6,000 images for three classes classification. Data Distribution of two and three classes classification is shown below:

# Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing
- To improve model performance and focus on relevant image features, the following preprocessing steps are applied:
    - Hair Removal: Removes hair artifacts that could interfere with lesion analysis.
    ![Hair Removal](./images/hair_removal.png)
    - Masking with Segmentation: Isolates the lesion region, reducing the influence of background features.
    ![Segmentation](./images/segmentation.png)
2. Feature Extraction
    - Color Histogram: Captures color distribution within each region.
    - Local Binary Pattern (LBP): Describes texture by encoding local intensity variations.
    - Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM): Quantifies spatial patterns in grayscale images.
    - Intensity Histogram: Represents the distribution of pixel intensities.
    ![Feature Extraction](./images/feature_extraction.png)
3. Spatial Histogram Descriptor
    - Divide the image into Grid Regions
    - Compute each feature and Concatenate Histograms
    ![Spatial Histogram Descriptor](./images/grid.png)
4. Model
    - Xgboost: A gradient boosting algorithm that builds an ensemble of weak learners to improve predictive performance.

# Training
1. Data Augmentation
![Data Augmentation](./images/augmentation.png)
2. The training is done using the Xgboost model. The model is trained using the extracted features from the images.
3. Grid Search is used to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a validation set using both binary and multi-class metrics.
